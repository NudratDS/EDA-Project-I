📊 Objective

The main objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis to answer questions such as:

What factors influence a movie's profitability?

Are there trends based on release year, genre, or director?

What is the correlation between budget, revenue, and profit?

Are certain genres consistently more profitable?

Who are the most profitable directors or actors?

📌 Key Features of the Analysis

✅ Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and corrected data types.

✅ Feature Engineering: Calculated new features like profit = revenue - budget.

✅ Visualization: Used libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for interactive and static visualizations.

✅ Insights: Identified trends and patterns to support business or creative decisions in the movie industry.
